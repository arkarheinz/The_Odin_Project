        <h1><strong>git commit</strong> command</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>git commit</strong> command is really useful for take note about git commit.<br>
            we can use <strong>git commit</strong> to write message or<br>
            we can use <strong>git commit -m "<em>the text you want as message</em>"</strong> command to write message.<br>
            we can edit <strong>git commit</strong> template by editing the file at <strong>~/.gitmessage.txt</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            If we want <strong>git commit</strong> command to use default in <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong>,<br>
            <strong>"git config --global core.editor "code --wait"</strong> this command will be make sure that default editor to VScode.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>git commit -m</strong> command is really strict to commit a message. A single line is ok to use this command.<br>
            Using <strong>git commit</strong> is really useful when you want to commit a full message.

        <h1>The seven rules of git commit message!</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Separate subject from body with a blank line</li>
            <li>Limit the subject line to 50 characters</li>
            <li>Capitalize the subject line</li>
            <li>Do not end the subject line with a period</li>
            <li>Use the imperative mood in the subject line.</li>
            <li>Warp the body at 72 characters</li>
            <li>Use the body to explain what and why vs .how is this happen!</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Separate subject from body with a blank</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Firstly, not every commit requires both a subject and a body. <br>Sometimes a single line is fine, especially when the change <br>is so simple that no further context is necessary.</li>
        </ul>
