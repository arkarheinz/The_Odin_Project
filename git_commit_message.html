        <h1>The seven rules of git commit message!</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Separate subject from body with a blank line</li>
            <li>Limit the subject line to 50 characters</li>
            <li>Capitalize the subject line</li>
            <li>Do not end the subject line with a period</li>
            <li>Use the imperative mood in the subject line.</li>
            <li>Warp the body at 72 characters</li>
            <li>Use the body to explain what and why vs .how is this happen!</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Separate subject from body with a blank</h3>
        <p>The first line of <strong>commit</strong> message is subject and the rest is called body.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Firstly, not every commit requires both a subject and a body.
                <br>Sometimes a single line is fine, especially when the change
                <br>is so simple that no further context is necessary.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </body>
