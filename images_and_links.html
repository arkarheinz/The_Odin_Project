    although most of the website are already have that kind of security, it better to put these on.
    
    target attribute is assigned to let know that what your link should be. It decide link to jump to another tab and open or
    open on the same web page. With the value of _blank your link will open in another tab and the value of _self will open link in same tag. 
    
    if you use absolute link, make sure include http:// in your rel value. if http:// is not include, the browser will search in your
    computer and reply an error page because it doesn't locate in your computer.
